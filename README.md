## Installation and Usage

- Clone or download the repository.
- Navigate to the respository folder.
- Open `index.html` to use the website.
- Alternatively, visit `https://ca-wishlist.netlify.app/`

## Bugs
- Server is quite slow. Multiple refreshes/resubmissions may be required on initial visit to the site. After an initial list retrieval or login is completed, the site should work as normal.

## Wins and Challenges

### Wins
- Server deployed to Heroku. Users can register or login to an account. Gifts can be created and retrieved.
- Users can choose which occasion they would like to add gifts to.
- Gifts can be deleted if no longer required.

### Challenges
- It took a while to get the site to deploy on Heroku, this required some changes to the webpack.
